# CurmudgeonsCastle
A class assignment for a terminal game called Curmudgeon's Castle that uses OOP and is created in C++ written by me.

** NOTE ***

Due to issues with emplace_back, two versions of castleClass are provided.

MAC USERS: castleClass will be used instead of castleClassDupe
WINDOWS USERS: castleClassDupe will be used
